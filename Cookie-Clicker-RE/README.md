Assignment Reflection - Cookie Clicker Project Using React

During the development of the Cookie Clicker project, I not only achieved the core goals but also met several stretch goals while enhancing my problem-solving and collaboration skills.

One of my key achievements was effectively utilizing React hooks. I implemented the useState hook to manage the state of variables like the cookie count and available upgrades, while useEffect was used efficiently to handle side effects, such as setting up the interval that incremented the cookie count every second. I also returned JSX from components other than App.jsx, like CookieCount.jsx and CookieUpgrades.jsx, which improved the modularity and maintainability of the code.

Another accomplishment was using setInterval to perform periodic tasks, specifically to automatically increase the cookie count over time. I also leveraged the .map() function to dynamically render upgrade items based on data from an API, ensuring a responsive interface. Furthermore, I implemented logic to manage the purchase and application of upgrade items, ensuring that the user could only purchase upgrades when they had enough cookies, while greying out the purchase button when upgrades were unaffordable.

In addition to these core goals, I successfully met the stretch goals. I used local storage to automatically save and retrieve game data, so the player's progress persisted even after the browser was closed, without needing a manual save button. This added significant convenience for users and enhanced the overall gameplay experience.

I also used an Upgrades API to manage game upgrades, fetching data dynamically and applying the upgrades effectively. This integration made the game more interactive and future-proof, as new upgrades could be easily added without modifying the core logic.

On the design side, I placed a strong emphasis on styling the application excellently. I ensured a responsive and mobile-first layout that adapted to different screen sizes, while making the game visually appealing with a clean, user-friendly interface.

Throughout the project, I encountered various bugs, particularly with managing the cookie counter and upgrade logic. Debugging these issues taught me valuable lessons in isolating problems and testing potential solutions. Collaborating with classmates by comparing notes and discussing different approaches was also incredibly helpful, particularly in refining my strategy for using local storage and managing state more effectively.

Overall, this project allowed me to achieve both core and stretch goals while improving my technical, problem-solving, and collaborative skills.
